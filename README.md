### About Walmart

Walmart is a leading American multinational retail corporation that operates a vast network of supercenters, discount department stores, and grocery outlets. With over 100 million customers worldwide, it plays a significant role in global retail.

### Business Problem

Walmart's management seeks to analyze customer purchasing behavior, particularly purchase amounts, in relation to gender and other factors to enhance business decision-making. They are particularly interested in understanding whether spending habits differ between male and female customers, such as whether women spend more than men on Black Friday. The analysis assumes an equal split of 50 million male and 50 million female customers.

### Dataset

The dataset includes transactional data from customers who made purchases at Walmart stores during Black Friday. It contains the following features:

- **User_ID:** User ID
